# Changelog

All notable changes to MightiePack. The format follows Keep a Changelog, and the
project uses semantic-ish versioning: the pack version in `MightiePack.toc` is the
one CurseForge shows, and the bundled modules report the same number.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `/mp bug` (also `/mpack bug`, and a Report a bug button) opens a movable popup with a pre-filled, already-selected report to copy into #mightiepack-bugs. Addon version, client version, enabled modules, class and level, zone/map, and the last MightiePack Lua error are filled in; character names and realms are left out. WoW cannot write the clipboard, so the player presses Ctrl+C.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- Skinning farming circles: closed routes built from the character's own recorded
  skins, per zone, drawn on the world map and the minimap, shown only once a zone
  has skinning data and only to a character with Skinning.
- Herb tooltip drop rates and pick counts per node.
- Touchstone gear advice inside the pack: a two-tier verdict where Strength,
  Spell Power, Agility and Intellect decide, and Armor and Stamina break ties only.

### Changed
- The world-map route is parented to `WorldMapFrame` and projected onto the visible
  map rect; children of the map canvas are not composited on this client, which is
  why the route used to be invisible.
- The minimap route is drawn from the zone's real yard scale (measured at three
  points in the Barrens) instead of a fixed map fraction.
- The waypoint arrow is off by default and a stored "on" from an earlier build is
  migrated off once.
- Auto-refresh re-plans every 5 gathers.

### Fixed
- Tooltip panels no longer advertise Alchemy recipes the character cannot make; the
  recipe-uses line is parked behind a default-off switch until the client's recipe
  API can be trusted again.
- Beast tooltip shows skinning yields only.
- Toasts no longer outlive their intended lifetime.

## [0.2.0]
- NodeTrail herb routing, map and minimap overlays, recorder.
